# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
### An analysis of ride-sharing data by city type was completed using Pandas and Matplotlib. The following deliverables are provided:
### Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
### Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
### Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

## Results 
Based on the data analysis the Urban areas have a larger number of total rides, drivers, and fares followed by the surbrband areas and lastly the rural areas. This is not unexpected and follows national trends.

## Summary 
Based on the Fare by City Type graph the rural areas appear to show a downward trend while the surburban areas are shwoing growth. The urban areas are showing a flater line. If resoruces are to be shifited it is suggested that the growing surburban area should take priority.
